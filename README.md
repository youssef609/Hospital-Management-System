The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a web-based application developed using
ASP.NET Core MVC with a SQL Server backend. The primary objective of this system
is to streamline the management of hospital operations by providing a comprehensive
platform for managing patient appointments, medical records, diagnoses, and user
accounts. The system offers distinct functionalities for three types of users: patients,
doctors, and administrators.
• Patients can easily book, view, and cancel appointments, as well as access their
medical history.
• Doctors can view their scheduled appointments, review patient history, and
update diagnoses and treatment details.
• Administrators can manage user accounts (both doctors and patients), add new
doctors, and access any user data for monitoring purposes.
